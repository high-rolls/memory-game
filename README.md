## 📌 Challenges & Learnings

This started as a small test to build a game in under **4 hours** — but evolved into weeks of tweaking animations, state management, performance optimizations and experimenting with modern front-end patterns.

Through this project, I practiced:
- Managing **global state** with custom contexts and reducers
- Animating UI feedback for score and stars
- Designing an **accessible** and responsive UI
- Keeping gameplay snappy with memoization and efficient re-renders
